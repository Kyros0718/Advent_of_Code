# Advent_of_Code
> **Advent of Code** is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.


This is a Christmas-Themed event that occurs annually. From the start of December until Christmas (December 25), a challenge will be posted per day.
